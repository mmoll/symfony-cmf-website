title: "Symfony CMF 2.0.0 First Release Candidate"
publish_start_date: "2017-01-21"
body: |
    We are getting ready with the CMF 2.0 release! The most important feature
    is support for Symfony 3. We are in the process of tagging release
    candidates and hope to gather feedback in the next weeks, before we tag
    stable versions.

    We created the #symfony_cmf channel on the [Symfony Slack](https://slackinvite.me/to/symfony-devs)
    to improve collaboration, as few people are on IRC anymore.

    ### What is new?

    The upcoming versions will support Symfony 3.1 and higher, as well as
    version 2.8 LTS. They require PHP 5.6 or 7. Deprecated code from the 1.x
    versions has been removed.

    If you use the Sonata Admin in your project, note that we moved the admins
    out of the individual bundles into the symfony-cmf/sonata-phpcr-admin-integration-bundle.

    Then, some of the bundles also have new features:

    * MenuBundle is released as 2.1 because there already was a 2.0. Note that
      the sonata admin classes for the menu bundle were also moved to the
      separate admin integration bundle.
    * RoutingAuto supports multiple routes per document, e.g. to create REST APIs.
    * TreeBrowserBundle got completely rebuilt, providing a much nicer tree
      with extensibility and better Javascript libraries. It now also provides
      a form type for the tree widget.
    * SeoBundle supports guessing the modified date and depth from the content.

    ### How to upgrade?

    We removed deprecated code. Before upgrading, run your tests and check for
    deprecation warnings in the test log.

    Each repository contains a UPGRADE-2.0.md file that should explain the
    changes you need to do when migrating to version 2. Those instructions
    could be incomplete at this point - if you have time to test the migration,
    please reach out to us on github if you find inaccuracies or information is
    missing.

    ### Documentation, Documentation, Documentation!

    Quite a bit of the changes are not yet reflected by the documentation on
    symfony.com. This will be the largest part of work to be done before we
    can tag a stable release.

    We would be very glad for help on finishing the changes. You can help by
    proof reading the parts that are already done, reviewing pull requests
    or checking existing documentation and updating where its not accurate
    anymore.

    ### Some components no longer maintained

    To focus our resources, the CMF core team decided to stop maintaining some
    optional components for the time being. While they all have their merit, we
    just don't have enough time to work on all that has been created over the
    last 5 years. Rather than having badly maintained components confuse users,
    we want to be transparent. The affected bundles are: CreateBundle,
    MediaBundle, SearchBundle and SimpleCmsBundle.

    If you want to help co-maintaining any of those packages, tell us in a
    GitHub issue or in #symfony_cmf of [Symfony slack](https://slackinvite.me/to/symfony-devs).
